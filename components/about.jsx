              <span>Eye For Code</span> was born from a vision to transform traditional education and showcase the true potential of emerging talents in the tech world. 
              We believe that coding is not just about creating clones or prebuilt projects, but a gateway to innovation, collaboration, and real-world impact. 
              Our community aims to bridge the gap between classNameroom knowledge and practical experience.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With a focus on diversity, skill-sharing, and ownership, EyeFor Code is more than a community â€“ it's a movement that empowers individuals to create, collaborate,
               and leave their mark on the digital landscape.
